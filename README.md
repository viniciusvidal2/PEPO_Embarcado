# PEPO_Embarcado
This is a repository for the 3D Scanner called PEPO, developed for the Project "Virtual". It is composed of an embedded NVidia Jetson Nano board, a Livox MID-40 lidar sensor, a Full HD Logitech USB camera, Dynamixel servo motors and a wireless router, everything meant to reconstruct objects and the whole environment around it!

This repository is dedicated to the Edge node of the architecture, so everything is developed for an embedded NVidia Jetson Nano running Ubuntu 18 and ROS Melodic. If you are interested in the Fog node environment (laptop), take a look in our [FOG repository](https://github.com/viniciusvidal2/PEPO).

Check out a picture of the first prototype developed by Antonio, a member of our team.
